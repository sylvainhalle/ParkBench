/**
 * Manages the execution of tests using multiple threads.
 * The dispatcher works as follows.
 * <ol>
 * <li>The benchmark puts tests in the dispatcher's queue using
 *   {@link #putInQueue(Test)}.</li>
 * <li>The dispatcher periodically checks whether some tests are present
 *   in the queue (the infinite loop of method {@link #run()}, which
 *   calls {@link #check()}.</li>
 * <li>If this is the case, the dispatcher loops through its array
 *   of threads to see if any of them has stopped. If so, the
 *   dispatcher creates a new {@link TestThread}, pops into it the first test
 *   from the waiting queue, starts it and puts it into the
 *   array's vacant slot.</li>
 * </ol>
