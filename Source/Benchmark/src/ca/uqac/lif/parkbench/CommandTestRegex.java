/**
 * Runs a test by running a command, created from a regular expression
 * involving test parameters.
 * 
 * For example, suppose the test has a parameter named "length", and that
 * one wishes to launch the command <tt>mycmd</tt>, passing the value of
 * "length" through the argument <tt>--len</tt>. One can instantiate
 * this with the pattern:
 * <pre>
 * mycmd --len &lt;length&gt;
 * </pre>
 * During execution, the string <tt>&lt;length&gt;</tt> is replaced by
 * the current value of the parameter "length" and the command is executed.
